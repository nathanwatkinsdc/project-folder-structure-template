# 🧱 project-folder-structure-template

A flexible, production-ready folder structure template for data science projects, supporting both **Python** and **R**. This repository helps you start your project on the right foot—whether you're prototyping, collaborating, or building something for deployment.

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository provides standardized, well-documented templates for organizing end-to-end data science projects. It includes two fully realized subdirectories:

- [`python/`](./python) – A template optimized for Python workflows, automation, and model pipelines
- [`R/`](./R) – A template structured as an R package with integrated R Markdown, testing, and reproducibility tools

Each is independently usable and contains its own `README.md` with detailed usage instructions.

## 🐍 Python Template Highlights

📁 [Explore the Python template →](./python)

A modern, opinionated structure built for scalable, testable, and production-oriented Python workflows.

**Key Features:**
- `src/` module layout with modular code
- `notebooks/` for structured analysis (EDA, modeling, deployment prep)
- `config/` with YAML-based configuration
- `Makefile` automation (setup, linting, data, testing)
- `.env` integration for secrets and deployment
- Full test suite with `pytest`
- Ready for deployment and CI/CD extension

## 📊 R Template Highlights

📁 [Explore the R template →](./R)

An R package-style structure supporting tidy workflows, reproducible research, and production-ready modeling.

**Key Features:**
- Structured as an installable R package
- `renv`-based reproducible environments
- Modular R scripts in `/R/` for core functionality
- Structured R Markdown notebooks in `/notebooks/`
- `Makefile` commands for automation
- Integrated testing via `testthat`
- YAML-based config, logging, Dockerfile, and even Plumber API support

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanwatkins/project-folder-structure-template.git
